# kpmpy
Python package implementing the kernel polynomial method, for details see https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0504627

# Capabilities #
Allows to calculate density of states and correlation functions of very large sparse matrices (10^6 sites)

# How to compile #
The main function can be called from a Python script. They use routines written in FORTRAN that should be compiled before
